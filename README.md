# CS330, Jacob Simmons
How do I approach designing software? Industry practice is to use the SDLC methodologies, where iterative approaches are made to approach the final goal. In regards to my approach to this assignment, I was to take a similar approach by virtue of the couse layout. Each week a new elements was added to the final project (e.g. light, texture, complex shapes, etc.).

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? The concept of creating anything in a graphics space was new before this class. I was able to successfully create this 3D scene with OpenGL for CS330.

What design process did you follow for your project work? I used an iterative process where each week I designed a new feature for the project as defined above.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? The concept of breaking down a larger project into smaller parts is very common and is representative of industry standard practices.

How do I approach developing programs? I approach them in a methodical and planned approach to drive to the solution. The SLDC methodologies are ideal for this scenario.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? The iterative approach is something that I am used to and will continue to use throughout my career/schooling.

How did iteration factor into your development? It was critical to the project success as I was used this each week to develop the end result.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion? The approach remainded the same throughout the course as I was developing each componenet each week and then arrived at the final solution by the end date.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? My long term goals are to be in the software space and this class is important to understanding aspects of computer science.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? Although graphics are not readily seen in my long term goals, it is good to understand how this works and it will help me have a wider understanding of computer science.
